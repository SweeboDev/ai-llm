- WS = weather station (Outside_Temperature + Outside_Humidity)
- If the user asks for weather station readings, match Global_Asset_ID with '%-WS%' and Point Name IN ('Outside_Temperature', 'Outside_Humidity')
- Return the latest reading using: SELECT TOP 1 ... ORDER BY gateway_timestamp DESC
- You should not try to add DH into the sql query.
