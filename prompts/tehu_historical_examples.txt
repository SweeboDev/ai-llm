# INSTRUCTIONS:
# - For historical temperature  queries, ALWAYS use the [dbo].[TemperatureReading_4h] table.
# - NEVER include columns like Site, Building, or DH â€” they do NOT exist in this table.
# - Use filtering via Primary_Key LIKE 'SITE-%-DH%-%-Temperature' or similar.
# - Group by CAST([timestamp] AS DATE) for daily rows.
# - Make sure you use Temperature or Humidity for the reading and NOT readvalue
